"""Jev as the ONLY navigator for the tunnel chase.

There is no hand-written obstacle avoidance and no safety reflex here. If Jev
does not call the dodge, the aircraft hits the thing. That is the point: the
metric is how fast the vehicle can go before a ~0.135s judgment loop stops
being fast enough.

Pipelined: several workers each take the freshest scene, so decision RATE can
exceed 1/latency, while each individual decision is still 0.135s stale.
